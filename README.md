# File tree

is little project to understand how React works.

### What does it do?

- on click open/close a folder
- folder icon changes & arrow turns to indicate folder is opened/closed
- each file has an icon matching to it's extension

### Gains

- better understanding of how to use useState hook
- learned how to put one component into another
- learned how to add style in React code
- learned how to add icons
- fun creating conditions
- joy from using ternary operators(not a fan of TO myself,but here they really fit)

**BONUS** learn how to deploy React app on GitHub

I used this amazing tutorial for [inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ1OA9Wyf2U&t=1s) - watched it ysterday, wrote code by myself today with a few changes.
